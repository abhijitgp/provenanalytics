# Web-app for Proven Analytics Platform.

I consulted for Proven - a startup company committed to providing personalized skin care powered by data. As a first step toward this goal, I mined over 28,000 product reviews written by consumers of over 750 skin care products. I built a topic model (using Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm (LDA) - an unsupervised machine learning technique) to extract prominent topics related to the products. 

Further, I built a web-based analytics platform that the company could use for internal purposes. This platform allows for :
1. In-depth analysis of various skin-care product categories.
2. Visualize the LDA model.
3. Predict new/unseen reviews to quantify the reviewer sentiment and identify topics association.

The app is available at:

If this repo is downloaded, run using ./run.py when in the app directory.
